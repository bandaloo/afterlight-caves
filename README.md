# Bounce Game

I am working on a fun game where you bounce a ball around a big world filled
with lines.

## Development

I don't use any front end build tools. Instead, I just use Javascript modules
directly since they've been in the standard for a long time now. Hopefully
someday bundlers will become not so important anyway.

I also use the Prettier code formatter to simplify things.
